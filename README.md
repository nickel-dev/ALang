A variable based programming language.  

## What is it?
This is a new concept where everything in code is a variable, variables can take arguments and can returns studd just like in maths.  

Example main function:
`main : i32 = 0;`    

This up here is a valid main function due to it just returning zero because everything is a variable.  
This simple ides supports multiple programming styles like OOP, DOP, and Functional Prgramming.
